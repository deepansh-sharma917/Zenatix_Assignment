Total Power Consumption Per Site: 
   SELECT site_id,
   SUM(sensor_value) AS total_power_consumption FROM Sensor_Data WHERE
   sensor_name = 'power_consumption' GROUP BY site_id,period,year;
Meters with Highest Power Usage Per Site: 
    SELECT site_id, meter_id,
    MAX(sensor_value) AS max_power FROM Sensor_Data WHERE sensor_name =
    'power_consumption' GROUP BY site_id, meter_id; 
Missing Timestamps:
   SELECT site_id, meter_id FROM Sensor_Data GROUP BY site_id, meter_id
   HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT timestamp)< (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT timestamp)
    FROM Sensor_Data);
